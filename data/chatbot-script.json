      "response": "Great question! Here are key signs of phishing emails:\n\n1. **Urgent language** - 'Act now!' or 'Account suspended!'\n2. **Suspicious sender** - Check if the email domain matches the company\n3. **Generic greetings** - 'Dear Customer' instead of your name\n4. **Spelling errors** - Professional companies proofread\n5. **Suspicious links** - Hover before clicking to see the real URL\n\nWould you like to take a quick phishing quiz?",

      "response": "Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an extra security layer:\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Enter your password (something you know)\n2. Verify with a code sent to your phone (something you have)\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Even if hackers get your password, they can't access your account\n- You get alerts when someone tries to log in\n- Most major services offer it for free\n\n**Enable 2FA on:** Email, banking apps, social media, and shopping sites!",
