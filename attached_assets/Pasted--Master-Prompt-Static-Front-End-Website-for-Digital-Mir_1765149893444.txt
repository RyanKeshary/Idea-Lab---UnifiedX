### **Master Prompt: Static Front-End Website for "UnifiedX" – Pure HTML/CSS/JS Prototype**

Build a complete, fully functional static website for the "UnifiedX" platform using ONLY vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks, libraries, build tools, or backend technologies are permitted. The entire application must run directly in any modern browser and be deployable instantly on GitHub Pages.

Technology Requirements: Use only standard HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (ES6+). Absolutely no React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, TypeScript, JSX, SASS, Bootstrap, Tailwind, or any other libraries or frameworks. No backend code, databases, or server-side processing is allowed. Data persistence must be achieved through browser localStorage and sessionStorage only. All mock data should be stored in static JSON files or hardcoded JavaScript arrays. External resources are limited to: Google Fonts (Inter and Open Sans), Font Awesome icons via CDN, and the Google Maps JavaScript API (with a demo key and a fallback static map).

Project Structure: Create a clean, organized folder system. The root should contain HTML files: index.html (landing page), login.html, signup.html, dashboard.html, transit.html, digitalshield.html, udyamhub.html. A css folder with main.css, themes.css, and responsive.css. A js folder with main.js, auth-simulator.js, theme-manager.js, chatbot.js, map-simulator.js, and store-builder.js. A data folder with stations.json, chatbot-script.json, and products.json. An assets folder for images and icons.

Design and Layout: Implement the entire visual design using pure CSS. Use CSS variables to define the exact color palettes for light and dark themes as specified. Build all layouts with CSS Flexbox and Grid. Create a responsive, mobile-first design with media queries for breakpoints at 320px, 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px, and 1600px. All components—navigation bars, cards, buttons, forms, modals, and tooltips—must be crafted from scratch with CSS. Implement smooth animations and transitions using only CSS animations and the transition property.

JavaScript Functionality: Write all logic in vanilla ES6+ JavaScript. Organize code using the module pattern with IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions). Simulate authentication by storing and validating user credentials in localStorage. Implement a theme toggler that switches between light and dark modes, saving the preference to localStorage and applying smooth CSS transitions. Build a static chatbot with predefined conversation flows stored in a JavaScript array; simulate typing indicators and timed responses. Create an interactive map using the Google Maps JavaScript API with hardcoded markers for Mira Bhayandar metro stations; include a fallback static SVG map if the API fails. Develop a simulated e-commerce interface with a product catalog and a cart using localStorage. Implement a drag-and-drop store builder using the native HTML5 Drag & Drop API. Handle all form validation with real-time feedback using vanilla JavaScript.

Features and Pages: The landing page (index.html) must introduce the platform with clear navigation. The authentication pages (login.html, signup.html) must have functional forms that validate input and simulate login by saving a user session to localStorage. The dashboard page (dashboard.html) must display three interactive module cards (Transit Companion, Digital Shield, Udyam Hub) that link to their respective pages. The Transit Companion page (transit.html) must show the interactive map with clickable markers displaying mock schedule data. The Digital Shield page (digitalshield.html) must host the chatbot widget and simulated lesson progress trackers. The Udyam Hub page (udyamhub.html) must showcase the no-code store builder UI and a product management interface.

Interactivity and UX: Ensure all interactive elements have visual feedback: buttons should have hover and active states, form fields should show focus states, and cards should have subtle hover animations. Implement a fixed navigation header that becomes solid on scroll and collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile. The theme toggle button must be present on all pages. The chatbot must be a fixed-position element at the bottom-right corner of the screen, with open/close animations. All page transitions should be smooth, either through dynamic content loading with the Fetch API or simple page navigation.

Accessibility and Standards: The site must be fully accessible, conforming to WCAG 2.1 AA. Use semantic HTML5 elements. Provide ARIA labels where necessary. Ensure keyboard navigation works throughout. Maintain a logical tab order. Include a skip-to-content link. All images must have descriptive alt text. Color contrast ratios must meet accessibility standards in both themes.

Performance and Deployment: Write efficient, commented JavaScript. Use event delegation where appropriate. Ensure the site loads quickly by optimizing assets. All code must be cross-browser compatible. The final product must be a standalone set of files that run directly when opened in a browser. Structure all file paths to be relative for seamless GitHub Pages deployment. Include a basic 404.html page.

Deliverable: A fully working, multi-page website that simulates the core UnifiedX experience using only front-end technologies. Users should be able to sign up, log in, view their dashboard, interact with all three modules, toggle themes, and have their progress persist across sessions via localStorage—all without any backend or framework dependencies. The site must be visually polished, responsive, and ready to be uploaded to GitHub Pages for public demonstration.
